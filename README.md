# FaceRecognition with PCA & KNN

Face Recognition using dimensionality reduction with PCA (Principal Component Analyisis) made from Scratch and KNN (K-nearest neighbors) with YALE B dataset,
registering models with MLFLOW in localhost. 

The goal of this project is about, to make PCA from scratch and see its functionality and learn basic concepts about MLFLOW.

To reproduce the code, you need to download Yale Dataset in bpm compression and separate the content in two folders: 'train' and 'test'
